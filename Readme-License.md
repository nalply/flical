# What's this license?

This is the license text.

```
Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or to distribute the works is granted,
provided that all copyright notices appear unchanged in all copies. The works
are provided 'as is'. The authors disclaim any warranty whatsoever. In no
event whatsoever are they liable for any damage in any regard with the works.

This license text has the same obejctives as the ISC license but is shorter and
has a few changes:

- The word «software» is replaced with «works», because not all files in a
repository is source code for software. This word also emphasizes the artistic
character of software.

- The clause «for any purpose» in the ISC license text is superfluous. If you
omit it and just say «permission is granted», then it is implicit that you grant
permission for any purpose.

- The clause «with or without fee» is tautologic. Either you sell your software
-- but then you can't disclaim as much because of imperative law, see below --
or you don't. Tertium non datur, this means, there is no other way.

- The shouting case in license is just a form of bullying. I find that crude
and lowercased that part.

- The verbose listing of situations where warranties and liabilities are
disclaimed is a good try, but nope. Just use the small word «any»! It covers
all imaginable and even future unthinkable occurrences where something bad
happens. This said, I allowed myself to use the intensifier «whatsoever» anyway
to make it abundantly clear that all thinkable and unthinkable situations shall
be covered.

There's a somewhat dirty secret in law: Imperative law trumps licenses. One case
is you doing something illegal with your works. Disclaimers become suddenly a
lot less helpful. Another case is selling software. If you sell software you
are bound to some imperative laws depending on your jurisdiction.

What's the point of a long listing of situations then?

That's all, folks. I am sure this license reads a lot better than the original
ISC license or the MIT license.
