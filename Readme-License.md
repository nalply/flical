# What's this license?

This license has the same obejctives as the ISC license but is shorter and has
these changes:

- The word «software» is replaced with «works», because not all files in a
repository is source code for software. This word also emphasizes the artistic
character of software.

- The clause «for any purpose» in the ISC license text is superfluous. If you
omit it and just say, permission is granted, then it's implicit that you grant
permission *for any purpose*.

- The clause «with or without fee» is tautologic. Either you sell your software
or you don't. Tertium non datur, this means, there is no other way.

- The shouting case in license is just a form of bullying. I find that crude.

- The verbose listing of situations where warranties and liabilities are
disclaimed is a good try, but nope. The small word «any» suffices and fits even
better. «Any» covers all imaginable and unthinkable occurrences when something
weird happens. This said, I allowed myself to use the intensifier «whatsoever»
to make it abundantly clear that really all situations shall be covered.

Please note that here's a somewhat dirty secret in law: Imperative law trumps
licenses. One case is you doing something illegal with your works. Disclaimers
then become suddenly a lot less helpful. Another case is selling software. You
will be bound to some imperative laws depending on your jurisdiction.

What's the point of a long disclaiming listing then?

That's all, folks.
