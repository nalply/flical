# What's this license?

This is the license text.

```
Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or to distribute the works is granted,
provided that all copyright notices appear unchanged in all copies. The works
are provided 'as is'. The authors disclaim any warranty whatsoever. In no
event whatsoever are they liable for any damage in any regard with the works.

```

This license text is influenced by the ISC license but is a lot conciser. It
has the same objectives as the ISC license. That's why I use «ISC+» as the SPDX
license identifier.

These are the rationales for some modifications of the ISC license text.

The word «software» is replaced with «works», because not all files in a
repository is source code for software. This word also emphasizes the
artistic character of software.

The clause «for any purpose» in the ISC license text is superfluous. If you
omit it and just say «permission is granted», then it is implicit that you grant
permission for any purpose.

The clause «with or without fee» is tautologic. Either you sell your software
-- but then you can't disclaim as much because of imperative law, see below --
or you don't. Tertium non datur, this means, there is no other way.

The verbose listing of situations where warranties and liabilities are
disclaimed looks quite intimidating, but is unneccessary. The small word «any»
suffices. It covers all imaginable and even future unthinkable occurrences
where something bad happens. There's even less risk it seems, because if you
try to create an exhaustive list but forget something it could be argued that
you didn't intend to include that thing you forget, because after all you didn't
mention it. It's better to use a simple catch-all phrase.

This said, I allowed myself to use the intensifier «whatsoever» anyway to make it
abundantly clear that all thinkable and unthinkable situations shall be covered.

What was written in shouting case in the ISC license is lowercased as well. That
part in the ISC and other licenses looks really terrifying, but this is just
trying to bully your opponents into sumbission. If you absolutely want to do
that, you are free to uppercase your license text.

Then there's the fact that imperative law trumps licenses. One case of many is
you doing something illegal with your works. You can't assert the disclaimer in
such a case. Additionally if you sell software you are bound to some imperative
laws depending on your jurisdiction. Keeping this in mind it is even easier just
to use the word «any», because something stronger be able to override your
license is always implicit.

Hopefully this license reads a lot better than the original ISC license or the
MIT license. It is not as impressive and fear-inducing but do you want that?
